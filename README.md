# Machine-Learning-Projects#

This project uses Machine Learning to classify Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their features such as:
•	Sepal Length
•	Sepal Width
•	Petal Length
•	Petal Width

The model is built using Logistic Regression from scikit-learn.

# Project Strcuture:

iris_classification.ipynb   → Jupyter Notebook containing full ML workflow
README.md                   → Project documentation

# Machine Learning Workflow

1. Load Dataset
•	Used the Iris dataset from scikit-learn.

2. Data Splitting
•	Split into training and testing sets:
o	train: 70%
o	test: 30%

3. Model Used
•	Logistic Regression
•	Simple
•	Fast
•	Highly accurate for this dataset

4 . Model Accuracy
•	Achieved:
•	Accuracy: 1.0 (100%)


This dataset is very clean and small, so Logistic Regression performs extremely well.

Technologies Used:
•	Python
•	Jupyter Notebook
•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	Scikit-learn
•	Matplotlib (optional for graphs)

Key Learnings:
•	How to use scikit-learn datasets
•	Train-test split
•	Build, train, test ML model
•	Evaluate accuracy

•	Create clean ML workflow in Jupyter Notebook
•	Upload ML project to GitHub

How to Run This Project:
Install dependencies:
•	pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

Launch Jupyter Notebook:
•	jupyter notebook

Open:
•	iris_classification.ipynb
•	Run all cells.
